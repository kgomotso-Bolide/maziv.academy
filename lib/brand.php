/* Everything that makes this installation Maziv rather than one of the other
 * three academies.
 *
 * THIS IS THE ONLY PER-SITE PHP FILE. Every other .php file in this repository
 * is shared verbatim with SPS, Fungi and the rest, and is written here by
 * tools/sync-backend.php in the SPS repository, which overwrites without
 * asking. It refuses to touch this one.
 *
 * So: if you want to edit a page because "Maziv says X and SPS says Y", the
 * answer is a new key in here and brand('key') in the shared page — added to SPS
 * and synced back out. Edit the page here instead and the next sync reverts you.
 *
 * Nothing secret belongs here — this file is deployed into the web root with
 * everything else. Credentials live in ~/private/mazivacademy-config.php.
